# SwitchScripter (IDE)

## Purpose
- GUI environment for editing script declarations, testing (legacy), and working with script folders/packages.
- Requires an active Scripting Module license to access the scripting API fully (metadata, etc.).

## Key Areas
- Workspace window with toolbar and panes for declaration, properties, and messages.
- Use to edit `<ScriptID>.xml` safely; avoid manual XML edits.

## Usage Notes
- Install as separate application; launch to open script folders or packages.
- For Node.js/TypeScript code editing and debugging, prefer VS Code; SwitchScripter focuses on declarations and packaging.
