# Switch Scripting Examples

Curated, Switch-tested snippets for MCP retrieval. Keep them concise and specific to one task. Each example should state:

- Scenario/goal
- Switch/Node version tested on
- Prerequisites (Flow setup, properties, prefs)
- Code (with language tag, e.g., ```ts)
- Notes/caveats

Add tags in the filename or first heading to aid retrieval (e.g., `http/axios-webhook`, `jobs/child-job`, `metadata/xmp-query`). Keep one scenario per file.
